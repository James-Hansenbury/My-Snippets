# My-Snippets
A pile of code I've written over the years in various languages.

There is little to no connection between these codes.
The file names indicate generally what the content is and some of the important features of the code, such as functions or classes.

My main language is Python, but I first learned to code in C++ and have had some practice with Fortran.
I also know how to use Matlab and Unix, but they are not my first choices.
